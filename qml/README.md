- QML is a declarative language.
- QML allows user interfaces to be described in terms of their visual components and how they interact and relate with one another.

- A QML document defines a hierarchy of objects.
- Every QML document consists of two parts: imports section, object declaration section.
- The object declaration in a QML file defines what will be displayed
- It is possible to preview a QML document (Qt Creator -> Build -> QML Preview)
